# Python Crash Course Notes

## Basics
- Strings `str`
- Integers `int`
    - Long numbers can be written with underscores `_` for readability. `14_000_000_000`
- Floats `float`
    - Dividing ints will result in a float number
- Lists `list`
    - Collection of items (ints, strs, floats, lists, etc)
    - `.pop()`, `del x[x]`, `.remove()` remove items from a list, pop returns the value
- Tuples: `tuple`
    - Immutable list

### Some more tips
- Looking for documentation? No worries you can always run `python -m pydoc -b` and it will load your current environment packages and all its documentation in http://localhost:58261
- If you want to know more about a particular object you can always check it with help() or dir() functions. For example `help(list)` or `dir(list)`.
- You can also check what are the current built-ins available for you with: `help(__builtins__)` or `dir(__builtins__)`.
